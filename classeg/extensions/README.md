# Information on the pre-existing extensions
**default_*** extensions should not be modified. They are used as examples for the user to create their own extensions.
And are copied when you run classegCreateExtension.

**example_*** can be used as references as to what you can change around, as well as to be used as examples.
These ARE NOT heavily maintained, and may be missing new features.
